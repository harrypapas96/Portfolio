<p>For a university group project, we were required to create a social media campaign for a client. The client my group and I were assigned to was the South Australian Police.</p>
<p>The campaign we were asked to create was to either re-invent their current Party Safe campaign or to create our own version using the original as a scaffold. My group and I decided to create a hashtag on Instagram and create a website to showcase the photos.</p>
<p>My role for this project was to create the website.</p>
<p>I used an already made, royalty-free Bootstrap template as a scaffold and edited the website using HTML and CSS. I also used other external HTML, CSS and JavaScript scripts to provide extra functionality, for example; the comparative image slider. I also used other online software on the website, for example; I used an online service called Juicer to display the Instagram images on the website.</p>
<p><strong>Grade for this Assignment:</strong> HD<br />

<p>For my university assignment, I was asked to find a poorly designed website and improve the design. The website that I chose to improve was the website for Suzanne Collins, author of The Hunger Games trilogy.</p>
<p>This website was built using ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.</p>
<p>Because the website&#8217;s original extension (.aspx) would not upload online, I had to re-save the website with .html, therefore some of the website&#8217;s features may not work.</p>
<p>This website is also best viewed using Google Chrome.</p>
